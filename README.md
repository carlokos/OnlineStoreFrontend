# Online Store Backend
Project created at JavaSchool 2023, this repository saves my API for my onlineStore. It's a fully functional API using Spring, it is docker-file and it includes tests to check the code


# How to deploy
Before deploying, ensure you've downloaded both this repository and the **frontend** repository: [OnlineStoreFrontend](https://github.com/carlokos/OnlineStoreFrontend.git). 

Once you have both repositories on your machine, organize the directories correctly according to the `docker-compose.yml`. Please check the provided `docker-compose.yml` for guidance.


# How to use it

After setting up, run the following command: `docker-compose up`. No need to build any app since both repositories come with their respective builds.
